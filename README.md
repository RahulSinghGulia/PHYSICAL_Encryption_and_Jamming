# PHYSICAL_Encryption_and_Jamming
Secure Communication: Implement physical layer encryption techniques or jamming-resistant modulation.

The details of each part and the plots of the Encryption and Jamming communication system is discussed in https://learnwithpatience-wc.blogspot.com/2024/10/physical-layer-implement-encryption-or.html

To study the impact of jamming on secure communication, I will explore the following techniques:

1. Basic Encryption: Simple XOR encryption was used to demonstrate the concept of physical layer security.

2. Jamming Simulation: A specific frequency band was targeted for jamming, mimicking real-world interference scenarios.

3. Frequency Hopping: To counteract jamming, the transmission frequency was dynamically changed.

4. Advanced Encryption: AES-128 encryption was employed to enhance the security of the transmitted data.

5. Modulation: QAM modulation was used to map digital data onto analog signals for transmission.

6. Layered Encryption: A layered approach combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption was investigated to provide robust security.

7. Adaptive Modulation: The modulation scheme was dynamically adjusted to optimize performance based on channel conditions.

8. Error Correction: Hamming codes were used to introduce redundancy into the data and improve error resilience.

9. Jamming Detection: Techniques for detecting jamming based on changes in SNR were implemented to trigger adaptive countermeasures.
